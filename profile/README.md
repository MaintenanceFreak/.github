# Revolutionizing Asset Management


<p>Join us at the forefront of asset management innovation with MaintenanceFreak - the upcoming platform thatâ€™s more than just maintenance. Designed for those who relish the thrill of DIY and the precision of professional care, our platform is the future of managing, tracking, and enhancing the life of your vehicles, be it cars, planes, or anything that moves.</p>


  <p>
     Anyone that has ever tried to fix their car in their garage has come to understand one thing:
    <h2>USEFUL INFORMATION IS NOT EASY TO FIND</h2>
  </p>
  <p>Sure, if you're a good mechanic, you'll be able to figure it out regardless, but think about Granny Smith who lives down the street:
    Granny Smith doesn't know how to fix cars, and can no longer unlock her 1980 Mercedes-Benz 600 Grosser, which has a red puddle underneath it.<br>
    Flusterred that she won't make it to church, Granny Smith has to make a choice -
    <ol>
      <li><a>Order the maintenance manual</a></li>
      <li><a>Wait 6 weeks for it to be delivered</a></li>
      <li><a>Convince her family to attempt to figure out what's wrong with it</a></li>
      <li><a>Determine the *hopefully* correct discontinued parts on ebay</a></li>
      <li><a>Order them, and wait another 6 weeks for them to come</a></li>
      <li><a>Attempt to replace the *hopefully* bad part</a></li>
      <li><a>*Hopefully* be correct, and do the job right</a></li>
    </ol>
    <b>OR</b>
    <ul>
      <li><a>Pay an obsurd amount of money to have a specialist come and replace an o-ring.</a></li>
    </ul> 
    In a perfect world, one could just ask online, and have someone immediately come and say:
    <br> "Hey, I used to work on these back in the day! 9/10 times it's just an o-ring for the hydraulic locking mechanism. Here is a standard one you can use...  and these are the steps to replace it it."
    <br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately - now more than ever - the field of Asset Management has become overly commercialized, convoluded, and relavent information is becoming less accessible due to it being hidden behind a corporate pay-wall, or an oversaturation of unrelated videos getting promoted by keyword searches online.
    Time and time again, the existing tools we rely on tell us the same common things:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><a>"We have great parts. All of the parts, MILLIONS of parts. You'll definitely find what you need... eventually"</a></li>
      <li><a>"We have the answers. All of the answers, BILLIONS of answers... they're in our manuals, which you can rent for the day"</a></li>
      <li><a>"This is how you fix it... on a different model"</a></li>
      <li><a>"Our user experience is top knoch... on internet explorer"</a></li>
      <li><a>"I know you're just trying to see what the part looks like... so I made this 30 minute tutorial for you that shows it for one whole second."</a></li>
      <li><a>"We have everything you need in one place... for the low cost of $300 a month"</a></li>
      <li><a>The list goes on... and we're <b>ALL</b>... <b>SO</b>...<b>TIRED</b> of hearing it!</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <h2>
      WE'RE BUILT DIFFERENT
    </h2>
  </p>
  
  <p>Let's face it, they got greedy, they got complacent, they over-saturated their sites, and ultimately they let us all down. Why else would you be reading a landing page for a service that isn't even live yet? 
    <br>
    But I'll digress. Sit back, relax, grab a beer, you are welcome here. Let me introduce you to MaintenanceFreak: A veteran owned and operated startup, that is going to unapologetically change the way asset management is done.</p>
  <p>Picture this: 
    <ul>
      <li><a>One website, one mobile app - User friendly, Intuitive, and Secure.</a></li>
      <li><a>All of the tools you need: maintenance board, reminders, metrics, and more.</a></li>
      <li><a>Answers to all of your questions - tailored to you.</a></li>
      <li><a>Checklists and Video Tutorials that specify <b>EVERYTHING</b> - correct part numbers, the specific tools you'll need, and even the screws that might strip.</a></li>
      <li><a>A shop to purchase what you need, with the option to prefill your cart with the parts for your task.</a></li>
      <li><a>A community of maintainers, incentivised to help YOU.</a></li>
      <li><a>Planes, trains, AND automobiles - Hell, manage your lawn mower here, who are we to say no?</a></li>

    </ul>
