# Revolutionizing Asset Management

**Welcome to [MaintenanceFreak.com](https://maintenancefreak.com)** — the unapologetically badass platform for maintainers, mechanics, and anyone who believes the tools we use should actually work for us.

## 👨‍💻 Developers Welcome

We **love developers**. We love **open source**.  
While the core MaintenanceFreak platform won’t be open source (for obvious security and business reasons), we’re building an entire ecosystem around it — and a lot of it **will be**.

If you build tools, hack on cars, optimize workflows, or just like messing with code to make cool shit…  
We want you here.

Follow us, contribute to our open projects, and help us push this industry out of the dark ages.  
There’s a place for you in the **MaintenanceFreak ecosystem** — and we’d be stoked to have you.

🧪 **Sign up at [https://maintenancefreak.com](https://maintenancefreak.com)** to get invited to our **private beta** (coming soon) and future dev initiatives.  
Let’s build something worth bragging about.


## 🎯 What’s This All About?
MaintenanceFreak is a veteran-owned startup that’s rewriting the rules of asset management. 
Whether you’re tracking your fleet, fixing your car, managing an aircraft, or just trying to get your damn snowblower working — this is your new home.

Anyone who’s ever turned a wrench knows one brutal truth:

## 🔍 USEFUL INFORMATION IS HARD TO FIND

Sure, seasoned mechanics can eventually figure it out. But what about everyone else?

### Meet Granny Smith:
She’s 84, owns a 1980 Mercedes-Benz 600 Grosser, and wakes up to a red puddle under the car. She’s not making it to church unless she:

1. Orders the original manual
2. Waits 6 weeks for it to arrive
3. Convinces a relative to interpret it
4. Finds the right part (maybe) on eBay
5. Waits another 6 weeks
6. Installs it with crossed fingers
7. Hopes that was actually the issue

...or pays a specialist $600 to replace a rubber o-ring.

### In a better world:
Someone online who worked on these cars back in the day simply says:
> "Hey, it’s the hydraulic door lock o-ring. Here's the spec, a substitute, and how to swap it."

Instead, real answers are buried beneath SEO trash and paywalled PDFs. 
That’s why we built this.

## 🚫 We’re Not Like Them
We're not another parts warehouse pretending to be a platform. We don't want to rent you your own manuals, spam you with 40-minute videos, or sell $300 subscriptions to view basic data.

The current landscape? Bloated. Gatekept. Frustrating.

## 💥 We’re Built Different
**MaintenanceFreak** is:

- One powerful site + app
- Full asset tracking, maintenance boards, smart alerts
- Tutorials with exact tools, parts, and watch-outs
- A task shop that pre-fills your cart
- A pro community, rewarded for helping YOU
- Designed for everything from lawn mowers to jet engines
- FREE for everyday users — no strings

## 🔑 Want Early Access?
We’re launching soon, and if you like what we’re doing — sign up at [maintenancefreak.com](https://maintenancefreak.com).
All signups before launch will be **personally invited to our private beta**.

No spam. No paywalls. No gimmicks.
Just smarter maintenance. The way it should’ve always been.
